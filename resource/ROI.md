Straits AI: ROI Impact Analysis Website Plan

This document outlines the logic and key elements for an interactive ROI Impact Analysis tool on the Straits website. The goal is to create a user-friendly experience that demonstrates the value of your AI solutions in a tangible and compelling way.

Page 1: The Calculator - "Discover Your AI Potential"

This page will serve as the primary data input interface for the user. The design should be clean, intuitive, and aligned with the Straits brand identity.

I. Employee & Role Selection:

Element: A dynamic section allowing users to add and define different employee roles within their organization.

Logic:

Users can select from a predefined list of common roles (Sales Representative, Customer Support Agent, Office Clerk) 

II. Input Fields (Per Role):

Element: A series of sliders and input boxes for each employee role.

Logic:

Number of Employees: How many people are in this role?

Average Hourly Rate (MYR): To calculate the cost of time spent on manual tasks.

II. General Input Fields:

Win Ratio (%): The current success rate for deals.

Average Deal Size (MYR): The typical revenue generated from a successful deal.

Time Spent on Manual Outreach (Hours/Week): How much time is dedicated to cold calls, emails, and follow-ups?

Time Spent on Customer Support (Hours/Week): How much time is spent answering repetitive customer inquiries?

Time Spent on Document Processing (Hours/Week): How much time is spent on tasks like data entry from invoices or contracts?

III. AI Solution Mapping (Internal Logic):

Element: This will be a backend process, not visible to the user on this page.

Logic:

The inputs will be mapped to your specific AI offerings:

Customer Support Chatbot & CRM Automation: Will be linked to "Time Spent on Customer Support" and "Win Ratio."

Marketing Automation System: Will be linked to "Time Spent on Manual Outreach" and "Average Deal Size."

Document Understanding Pipelines & Internal Workflow Copilot: Will be linked to "Time Spent on Document Processing."

Custom LLMs & Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Can be presented as a more advanced solution for companies with high volumes of internal data and complex queries.

IV. "Calculate Your Impact" Button:

Element: A prominent call-to-action button.

Logic:

Upon clicking, the input data is processed, and the user is redirected to the results page.

The button should have a visually engaging hover effect to encourage clicks.

Page 2: The Results - "Your AI-Powered Future"

This page will present the results of the analysis in a clear, visually appealing, and easily digestible format. The focus here is on demonstrating the value and impact of Straits' AI solutions.

I. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) - At a Glance:

Element: A dashboard-style section at the top of the page with large, bold numbers.

Logic:

Total Time Reclaimed (Hours/Year): The cumulative time saved across all selected roles.

Estimated Annual ROI (%): The return on investment, calculated based on cost savings and revenue impact.

Potential Revenue Impact (MYR/Year): The projected increase in revenue due to improved efficiency and win rates.

Payback Period (Months): How quickly the investment in your AI solutions will pay for itself.

II. Detailed Analysis - "How We Get You There":

Element: A series of cards or expandable sections, each dedicated to a specific area of impact.

Logic:

Time Savings Breakdown:

A visual chart (e.g., a donut or bar chart) showing the time saved per role.

A detailed explanation of how AI automates tasks like customer support, outreach, and document processing.

Revenue Growth Projection:

A line graph illustrating the potential revenue growth over time with AI implementation.

An explanation of how improved win ratios and more effective outreach contribute to this growth.

Cost vs. Benefit Analysis:

A simple table comparing the estimated cost of Straits' AI solutions to the projected financial benefits.

This provides a clear and compelling business case for investment.

III. Personalized Recommendations - "Your AI Roadmap":

Element: A section that suggests specific Straits AI solutions based on the user's input.

Logic:

If a user indicated significant time spent on customer support, the "Customer Support Chatbot" will be highlighted as a primary recommendation.

If document processing is a major time sink, the "Document Understanding Pipelines" will be suggested.

Each recommendation will link to the corresponding product page on your website for more information.

IV. Call to Action - "Start Your AI Journey":

Element: A clear and compelling call to action at the bottom of the page.

Logic:

A button to "Schedule a Free Consultation" or "Request a Personalized Demo."

This will open a simple contact form or a calendar scheduling tool, making it easy for potential clients to take the next step.

Underlying Calculation Logic:

The core of the ROI calculator will be a set of formulas that translate the user's input into meaningful metrics. Here are some examples:

Time Reclaimed: (Time Spent on Manual Task per Week * 52) * Number of Employees * Automation Efficiency Rate

Automation Efficiency Rate will be a conservative estimate of how much time your AI can save (e.g., 70-80%).

Revenue Impact: (Average Deal Size * (New Win Ratio - Old Win Ratio)) * Number of Deals per Year

New Win Ratio will be a projected improvement based on the implementation of your AI tools.

ROI: ((Financial Gain - Cost of Investment) / Cost of Investment) * 100

Financial Gain will include both cost savings from reclaimed time and the projected revenue impact.

By following this plan, you can create a powerful and persuasive tool that effectively communicates the value of your AI solutions to potential clients in Malaysia and beyond.
